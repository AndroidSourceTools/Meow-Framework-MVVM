Use `Float.dp()` or `Int.dp()` to get a value of float or int into dip unit. See this example :

```kotlin
fun testDisplayMetricsDP() {
    // Returns 2f * app.resources.displayMetrics.density. If device has xxhdpi density (factor = 3) , the value of `someDp` will be `6f`.
    val someDp = 2f.dp()
    val someDpInt = 2.dp()
}
```
Use `Float.px()` or `Int.px()` to get a value of float or int (dip) into px unit. See this example :
```kotlin
fun testDisplayMetricsPX() {
    // Returns 6f / app.resources.displayMetrics.density. If device has xxhdpi density (factor = 3) , the value of `someDp` will be `2f`.
    val somePx = 6f.dp()
    val somePxInt = 6.dp()
}
```  
> You must bind your Application class with `meow.controller` in Application `onCreate()` to use above examples.
